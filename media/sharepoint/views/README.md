### 2. Adding an Access Control Column  
- After adding the necessary columns, create an additional column to indicate restricted access.  
- Name this column **access_blocked** (Text type).  
- This column will serve as a visual cue for users without the required permissions.

### 3. Applying a Filtering Trick  
- Open the **All Items** view settings and navigate to the **Filter** section.  
- Set the filter condition:  
  - **Comment begins with [Me]**  
- This ensures that no records match the condition, resulting in an empty list.

### 4. Styling the View  
- Go to the **Style** section and select **Boxed, no labels**.  
- This enhances the display of the restricted view.

- Enable the option to make this the **default mobile view**.

## Creating a Personal View for Advanced Users  

Since our application does not include a built-in module for tracking version history, creating a dedicated view for version tracking can be helpful, especially for HR.  

### Steps to Create a Custom View  
1. Navigate to **Create View** and select **Standard View**.  
2. Name the view, e.g., **my-view**.  
3. Select all necessary fields that should be included in the view.  
4. Mark this view as **Personal View** (only available to you).

## View Access Restrictions Demonstration  

Below are two screenshots demonstrating the results of the access control settings:  

1. **Restricted User View:**  
   - Only the **access_blocked** column is visible.  
   - The user cannot modify, add, or delete records.  
   - They also cannot add new columns to the view.

   ![list 0 elements](photos/filter_list_0_elements.png)

2. **HR/Administrator View:**  
   - Users with higher permissions can see additional columns.  
   - They have the ability to add new columns to **my-view**.  
   - Additional restrictions can be applied to prevent column modifications if necessary.

By following this configuration, you can effectively restrict access to SharePoint views while allowing privileged users to perform necessary actions.
