## 2. Creating Lists

1. Inside the newly created subsite, click **New** â†’ **List**.
2. Select **Blank List**.
3. Enter the **List Name** and proceed.
4. Enable the **Show in site navigation** option for better accessibility.
5. Assign permissions for each list:
   - Users responsible for adding new locations or currencies should have **edit permissions**.
   - Other users should have **read-only permissions** to prevent unauthorized modifications.
   - For better security, consider creating a third group with **higher permissions** than HR:
     - HR should only have **add permissions** without deletion rights.
     - The responsible person should have the highest **Edit permissions**.
